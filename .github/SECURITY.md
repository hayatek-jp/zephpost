## Reporting a Vulnerability

I appreciate your efforts to improve this project.  
To report a security issue, please use the [Security Advisory](https://github.com/hayatek-jp/zephpost/security/advisories).  
I will reply to your report within 3 days.  

Your report will be processed privately. And it will be made public only after the patch is released.  
Fixes are generally made within two weeks. If there are reasonable grounds why this is not possible, I will notify you of those grounds and then fix the vulnerability within two months.  
If these deadlines are exceeded, you may disclose your report without consultation.  

If you have a patch for the vulnerability, please copy and paste the contents of the patch file created by `git format-patch` so that your contribution can be merged into the repository.
